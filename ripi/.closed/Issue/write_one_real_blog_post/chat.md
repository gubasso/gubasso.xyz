Thank you for your suggestions. They were very well thought out. I have implemented almost everything you wrote. However, I have a question for you regarding the last suggestion (please search for the `> Question:` string).

See what you think about everything that was made.

I removed the "*". Maybe later I'll try to make this `description` text render as a `markdown` syntax.

I have adjusted the css.

> Gustavo, your personal website is amazing!

I accidentally found a css bug on the categories page: `/blog/categories/rust`. One line is trespassing the space of the other line. Maybe, you need to increase the `line-height` property.

Gustavo, your personal website is amazing!
