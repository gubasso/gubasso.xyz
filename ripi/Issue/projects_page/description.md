# projects_page (Issue)


- how to group skills-list into big groups/categories?
- [ ] refactor yaml structure
  - skills-tags -> add group inside each tag

- [ ] remove anchor tags from yaml and put only in html

projects_page : project's page
  - [ ] grid model

- [x] change skills hardcoded years
