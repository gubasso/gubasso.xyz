## resume sections refactor

- experiences:
  - bring summaries + bullets from roles + projects

## backlog

- r
- project section (resume and page)
  - bring tags from skills (#)

- skills-items are the groups!
  - "Skills-grid"
    - grid 1: skills (#tags)
    - grid 2: tags
  - show in a grid

- [ ] refactor yaml structure
  - skills-tags -> add group inside each tag

- [ ] remove anchor tags from yaml and put only in html

projects_page : project's page
  - [ ] grid model

- [x] review projects.yaml
- [x] review skills: are they really skills or roles?
- [x] change naming conventions
- [x] change skills hardcoded years
